        <h2 class="about-me">A little bit about me</h2>
        <p>Hi I'm Sarah. I discovered Crochet about 10 years ago and from that day I have been hooked (pun intended ðŸ˜Š).
            Iâ€™ve been crafting ever since I was a child, from making friendship bracelets and doing beadwork and knitting. 
            I have also always loved art and enjoy drawing and painting.  Over the last 10 years though Crochet has become my true love,
            I had gone from creating items from patterns, to designing my own patterns and then to teaching others how they can make amazing crochet items of their own.
            I really enjoy teaching others this craft and seeing their creativity bloom. </p>
            <p>I have been very lucky over the last number years to have my work featured in several crochet magazines, such as Simply Crochet and Crochet Magazine.
            I also have a large revelry page where I publish free patterns along with some paid patterns as well.</p>
            <p>My journey to teaching began when I started to teach my daughter and realised that I love to share this knowledge with her. I then began with one class a week and it has steadily grown from there. I am so excited to meet each of you who decide to take this journey through the world of crochet with me. And even if you canâ€™t take a class right now you can check out my ravelry page (linked here) or reach out to me on social media (You can find the links to my pages at the bottom of this page) </p>
        <h2 class="about-class">About the classes</h2>
        <p>The classes are held once a week. We work on one project for the full class term (This is called a crochet along or CAL for short).
             Each week you will receive a section of the pattern and we will discuss terminology and practice some of the trickier stitches and pattern repeats in class.
              You then take your project home and work on it for the week.</p>
    <p>
        If you come across any issues or questions before the next class, you can reach out on the pattern support page for your class. You will get access to this page when you sign up. It is a great resource and often other members of the group will also step in and help with questions and share articles or videos they have found helpful.
        I find that a great feeling of community grows in the class with everyone working together and giving each other tips and tricks. The classes are enjoyable and social. I provide tea and coffee and try to create a relaxed and welcoming environment so that we can all learn together and grow some friendships.
    </p>
    <p>You can find links to the projects for each class in the classes page of this website and a description of yarn and needles needed.  </p>
