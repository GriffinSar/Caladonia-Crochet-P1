# Caladonia Crochet

### Purpose
Caladonia Crochet is a website designed to advertise a crochet teachers’ classes and encourage people to sign up. It is also designed as a source of revenue outside of the classes as there are links to the creators’ paid patterns included on the site.<br>
This website gives the user an overview on the site owner and their teaching experience. It is designed to advertise their skills while also giving information on the actual classes themselves which is included on the Home page. The classes page gives the details on the time and dates of the classes. There is a gallery page displaying the teachers work. It also includes a form page where the user can sign up to be contacted about the classes. <br>
As this is a website for an artist it is designed to be aesthetically pleasing with many pictures and a cohesive colour scheme.

### Colour scheme
I have used a consistent colour scheme for this website to give a sense of cohesion and compliment the colourful images of crochet. The text is black and there is also white text used as well when black would not give a strong enough contrast. Links and navigation turn bright pink (#d813d2) when hovered over. The main body of the page is a very light pink rgb(248, 235, 242, 0.30) and it is accented with a dusky purple rgb(80, 16, 80, 0.30). The colours are muted except for a pop of bright pink on links when hovered over. This lets the colours of the imagery be the main focus of the page.

### Logo 

I created the logo for the website using Adobe logo creator. I wanted something that could act as a brand for the website. This can be used on the site owners social media and any patterns they create so that their work can be easily recognised and help bring users to the website.

### Typography

I choose the font to compliment the Logo. I choose Bitter and Open-sans. I used Bitter for my headings as it is similar to the Logo font. And open-sans is a complimentary font to Bitter. I wanted a very minimal font so as not to distract from the imagery.

### Imagery
I have used several images from the crochet teacher, her style is very colourful and vibrant. The muted colours of the website help to emphasise the vibrancy of the imagery. The images will create a sense of confidence in the teachers’ skills and hopefully encourage the user to want to learn to crochet also. The images in the gallery section all link to external sites such as ravelry where the user can purchase these patterns which can generate another revenue stream for the site owner. 
I have added drop shadows to the images to give a sense of depth to the page and this makes the imagery even more the focus of the page.

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Credits 

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
