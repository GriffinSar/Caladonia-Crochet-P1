# Caladonia Crochet 

### Purpose
Caladonia Crochet is a website designed to advertise a crochet teachers’ classes and encourage people to sign up. It is also designed as a source of revenue outside of the classes as there are links to the creators’ paid patterns included on the site.<br>
This website gives the user an overview on the site owner and their teaching experience. It is designed to advertise their skills while also giving information on the actual classes themselves which is included on the Home page. The classes page gives the details on the time and dates of the classes. There is a gallery page displaying the teachers work. It also includes a form page where the user can sign up to be contacted about the classes. <br>
As this is a website for an artist it is designed to be aesthetically pleasing with many pictures and a cohesive colour scheme.

# Target Audience
The target audience for this website are people who are interested in art and crafting and specifically those looking to learn crochet. There has been a huge resurgence in crochet through platforms such as instagram and pinterest so there is a market and need for a site where people in Ireland can sign up to learn crochet.
There is another audience of those who can already crochet who will find this website useful as a way to get an overview and easy access to the teachers crochet patters. 

# User Stories
### First Time Visitor Goals
As a first-time visitor I want to easily understand the purpose of the site and learn more about the crochet teacher. I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content. I want to view the website and content clearly on various devices. I want to be able to easily follow Caladonia Crochet on social media. I want to get an understanding of what is involved in the classes.
### Returning Visitor Goals
As a returning visitor I want to be able to contact the site owner to sign up or ask questions. I want to be able to find links to the crochet designs displayed on the site that I had seen on my initial visit.
### Frequent Visitor Goals
I want to be able to check if there are new classes being offered. I want to be able to check if there are new patterns advertised since the last time I visited.

# Design

### Colour scheme
I have used a consistent colour scheme for this website to give a sense of cohesion and compliment the colourful images of crochet. The text is black and there is also white text used as well when black would not give a strong enough contrast. Links and navigation turn bright pink (#d813d2) when hovered over. The main body of the page is a very light pink rgb(248, 235, 242, 0.30) and it is accented with a dusky purple rgb(80, 16, 80, 0.30). The colours are muted except for a pop of bright pink on links when hovered over. This lets the colours of the imagery be the main focus of the page.

### Logo 

I created the logo for the website using Adobe Express. I wanted something that could act as a brand for the website. This can be used on the site owners social media and any patterns they create so that their work can be easily recognised and help bring users to the website.

![responsive](assets/images/read.me/logo.png)

### Typography

I choose the font to compliment the Logo. I choose Bitter and Open-sans. I used Bitter for my headings as it is similar to the Logo font. And open-sans is a complimentary font to Bitter. I wanted a very minimal font so as not to distract from the imagery. 

![responsive](assets/images/read.me/typography.png)

### Imagery
I have used several images from the crochet teacher, her style is very colourful and vibrant. The muted colours of the website help to emphasise the vibrancy of the imagery. The images will create a sense of confidence in the teachers’ skills and hopefully encourage the user to want to sign up to her classes. The images in the gallery section all link to external sites such as ravelry where the user can purchase these patterns. This can generate another revenue stream for the site owner. 
I have added drop shadows to the images to give a sense of depth to the page and this emphasises the imagery further.

### Features Left to Implement

- In the future I hope to add a sign up feature where the user can subscribe to a newsletter to be alerted when new classes or patterns are released.
- Another feature that I would like to implement would be the some videos on the site to tutorials the teacher has created on Youtube as this is commonly seen on many crochet sites and would be another draw for the user. 

# Testing 

## Manual Testing

![Test1](assets/images/testing/test1.png)
![Test2](assets/images/testing/test%202.png)
![Test3](assets/images/testing/tests%203.png)
![Test4](assets/images/testing/test4.png)
![Test5](assets/images/testing/test5.png)


## Issues and Resolutions to issues found during testing
- Clicking the logo doesn't redirect to home page. I resolved this by adding a href link to the home page
- Images were too large causing performance issues. I resized images and converted some to gif to have the page run more smoothly.
- Spelling mistakes were found when proof reading, these were corrected.
- Form was accepting multiple selections for class level. Changed to radio so only one can be checked at a time.
